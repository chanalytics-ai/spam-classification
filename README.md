# Spam Text Classification using Simple Transformers

A repo containing text classification code used to identify spam messages for a class Kaggle competition. Library used is [Simple Transformers](https://simpletransformers.ai). The beauty about this library is that it requires very few lines of code to get a model up and running. However, you can customize and go more in-depth if you wish.

I placed 2nd in the private competition with a 98% accuracy.
